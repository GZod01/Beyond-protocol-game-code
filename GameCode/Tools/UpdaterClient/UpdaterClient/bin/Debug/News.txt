====== SERVERS ARE DOWN ======


Servers are down for our daily maintenance window. Expected downtime is 60 minutes.


We have updated our bandwidth pipes and the problem should now be forever resolved.

If you are having issues whatsoever (login, graphical, whatever it may be), go to LiveChat to talk to CSR.

ATTENTION:  DO NOT SKIP THE TUTORIAL.  THERE IS NO WAY TO TAKE YOU BACK THERE.
We have had people state that they skipped it and wished they had not...don't let this happen to you!

ATTENTION:  IF YOU HAVE SET YOUR GRAPHICS WITH Configure Client AND YOU ARE EXPERIENCING SUB-PAR GRAPHICS OR INABILITY TO PLAY, DELETE YOUR BPCLIENT.INI FILE

Please play with your graphics settings by pressing Escape. There are many graphics options that are off by default to ensure maximum performance and compatibility.

09/22/08

* Diplomatic Relationship standings can only be dropped by 5 per 4 hours.

* The chat window is now resizable

* The email received from the first tutorial will no longer allow players to double click the waypoint for the pirate factory causing players to get stuck in limbo

* Added tooltips, rearranged labels and adjusted the presentation of the Mineral Bidding window to illustrate that all 4 bidders in the list have rights to minerals should the mine be pulling sufficient resources

09/11/08
========
* Add a Restart Tutorial button for players who are in the tutorial and wish to start over

09/10/08
========

* Implemented a chat configuration window and chat channel listing window accessible from the quickbar

* Removed the need for mining routes in order to get minerals

* Mining Facilities no longer generate minerals into their cargo hold

* The mining window (F8 by default) is now the ticket to getting minerals on a planet
  * Implemented a new bid system for getting minerals on a planet
  * Select an item in the mining window to bring up the bid window
  * The bid system works in the following manner:
    * Every mining facility is owned by the private sector and takes bids
    * Players enter a bid amount (per mineral) and a Maximum Quantity
    * Maximum Quantity is the total minerals you wish to pull from the cache
    * Bid Amount is the amount of credits you will spend per mineral pulled
    * 20% of the total credits spent on bids is deposited into the owner of the mining facility credits
    * The top four bidders split the take of the minerals by 25%
    * If all 100% cannot be distributed (lack of bidders, funds, etc...) the top bidder receives the remainder at the top bidders bid price
    * If no bids, the minerals are not lost or distributed
    * Using Full Invulnerability will cancel all bids currently active
    * Owners of a planet get 20% of all bids on the planet they own

* Adjusted the costs for all technologies related to components for Tanks, Escorts, Frigates, Corvettes, Destroyers and Cruisers to bring them in line with the other hull types

09/04/08
========

* Step 57 should no longer get players stuck in the tutorial


09/03/08
========
* Fixed an issue with the client that made it reverse the armor integrity values for the armor builder based on minerals (minerals that were worst appeared to be better than the best minerals). The bug was only on the client and the client did not display the proper values. The server reported the actual numbers correctly and therefore, users who have made armors may have incorrect integrity values. Everyone is advised to check their armor designs for the actual integrity values before continuing use.


09/02/08
========
* Sound should no longer be required to progress in the tutorial
