conditions under which you may (<span class=SpellE>i</span>) install and use
the Software; and (ii) subscribe to, access and use Beyond Protocol&#8482;
online. DSE may amend this EULA from time to time by posting an amended version
at www.beyondprotocol.com. If you accept this EULA, the then-current version of
this EULA shall apply each time you access the System or play Beyond
Protocol&#8482;. <br>
<br>
By clicking the &quot;ACCEPT&quot; button below, and confirming your acceptance
by clicking the &quot;CONFIRMED&quot; button (or if you bypass or otherwise

     To play Beyond Protocol&#8482;, you must: (<span class=SpellE>i</span>)
     purchase a license to the Software (this may be available with the
     purchase of a boxed version of the Game and/or from the Beyond
     Protocol&#8482; web site http://www.beyondprotocol.com); (ii) establish
     online a valid account (an &quot;Account&quot;) and keep that Account
     active by paying the subscription fees on a timely basis; (iii) obtain and
     maintain your own Internet access (Internet access is required to play
     Beyond Protocol&#8482;; DSE is not responsible for your access to the

     1.5pt'>YOUR ACCOUNT</span></b><br>
     <span class=GramE>You</span> may establish only one (1) account for each
     copy of the Software licensed. If you wish to establish another Account,
     you must obtain another license for the Software (you may be able to do
     this by purchasing another boxed version of the Software or from the
     Beyond Protocol&#8482; Online web site http://www.beyondprotocol.com). <br>
     <br>
     <b>A. Establishing a New Account</b> <br>
     When it is first run, the Software will prompt you to register a new
     Account online. Upon establishing a new Account, you will be entitled to
     play Beyond Protocol&#8482; for thirty (30) days without paying the
     subscription fee because the purchase of the game includes a thirty day
     non-<span class=SpellE>transferrable</span> subscription. If your Account
     is not terminated in accordance with the procedures set forth below within
     that thirty (30) day period, you will be charged the subscription fees as
     described during the registration process when you established your
     Account. <br>
     <br>
     Only an individual, natural person who is an adult or, in the discretion
     of such an adult, his or her minor child, may establish an Account. You
     are responsible and liable for all activities conducted through your
     Account, regardless of who conducts those activities. <br>
     <br>
     You may not share your Account with anyone, or allow anyone other than you
     personally (or your minor child, if you have registered an Account on
     behalf of your minor child) to access or use your Account. Joint or shared
     ownership or use of an Account by more than one user is prohibited. <br>
     <br>
     Accounts may not be used for business purposes. Access to the System and
     playing Beyond Protocol&#8482; is intended for your personal
     entertainment, enjoyment and recreation, and not for corporate, business,
     commercial or income-seeking activities. Business entities and anyone who
     is acting for or on behalf of a business or for business purposes may not
     establish an Account, access the System or play Beyond Protocol&#8482;. <br>
     <br>
     <b>B. Passwords and Names</b> <br>
     You will be asked to select a password during the registration process
     (&quot;Password&quot;). You may not disclose your Password to anyone or
     allow anyone to use your Password to access the System or play Beyond
     Protocol&#8482;. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality
     of your Password and for any damage, harm, lost or deleted game objects,
     etc. resulting from your disclosure, or allowing the disclosure, of any
     Password, or from use by any person of your Password. You may not obtain,
     attempt to obtain, use or attempt to use the password of anyone else. You
     are responsible for remembering your Account information and Password. <br>
     <br>
     You will be assigned a login name and a game account name during the
     registration and game account creation process. You may not allow anyone
     to use your login name or game account name to access the System or play
     Beyond Protocol&#8482;. No player may use the game account name of another
     player to impersonate or falsely represent his or her identity. You may
     not obtain, attempt to obtain, use or attempt to use the login name or
     game object name of anyone else. <br>
     <br>
     You are encouraged to use a pseudonym, but you may not choose a name that
     violates anyone's trademarks, publicity rights or other rights. Acceptance
     of a pseudonym by the System does not mean that your chosen pseudonym does
     not violate anyone's rights. You are responsible for any liability
     incurred by yourself, DSE or anyone else due to the pseudonym you choose.
     DSE retains the right to reject any pseudonym it determines, in its sole
     discretion, is unlawful, indecent, <span class=GramE>obscene</span> or
     otherwise violates standards of good taste. <br>
     <br>
     <b>C. Children</b> <br>
     <br>
     <span class=SpellE><i>i</i></span><i>. Responsibility for Account</i> <br>
     Minor children may not establish an Account without the consent of a
     parent or guardian. If the user of Beyond Protocol&#8482; is a minor, a
     parent or guardian must complete the registration process to establish an
     Account, in which case the parent or guardian takes full responsibility
     for all obligations under the EULA and for all activities of the child
     using the Account. If you are a parent or guardian, you may permit one
     child to use the Account instead of you (in which case you may not use
     that Account). <br>
     <br>
     If you establish an Account, you represent that you are an adult eighteen
     (18) years of age or older and are either accepting the EULA on behalf of
     yourself or on behalf of your child, in which latter case you agree to the
     EULA with regard to your child and represent that you are also personally
     bound by the EULA. <br>
     <br>
     <i>ii. Game Rating</i> <br>
     <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span><br>
     DSE has established Rules of Conduct (discussed below) for players
     accessing the System and <span class=GramE>may</span>, but is not
     obligated to, monitor and take action regarding inappropriate conduct.
     Nonetheless, it is possible that at any time there may be language or
     other material accessible on or through the System that you may consider
     inappropriate for children or that may be offensive to some users of any
     age. You acknowledge that other players may transmit communications or
     content, or access to content, that you may consider inappropriate or
     objectionable. DSE does not, as a matter of policy, prescreen the
     communications or content transmitted by each player and is in no way
     responsible for the communications and content transmitted by players of
     the Game. <br>
     <br>
     DSE does not knowingly collect any information about children under the
     age of thirteen (18) beyond that necessary to establish an Account and
     play the Game. DSE will not disclose such information to any third party
     except as set forth below. </li>

     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>After the Beta Period, you will be
     required to pay a subscription fee to maintain your Account, access the
     System and play Beyond Protocol&#8482;. You are informed of the
     subscription fee and payment terms during the registration process. The subscription
     fee and payment terms will be incorporated in the EULA by reference. DSE
     may amend the subscription fee and payment terms at any time. <br>
     <br>
     All subscription fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable unless
     expressly stated otherwise in the EULA. When you establish your Account,
     you authorize DSE to automatically charge your credit card the
     subscription fees in accordance with the payment terms (as may be amended
     by DSE from time to time), plus any applicable taxes that DSE is required
     to collect. If DSE is unable to process your credit card at any time, your
     Account may be immediately suspended or terminated at <span class=SpellE>DSE's</span>
     discretion. <br>
     <br>
     You are responsible for reviewing <span class=SpellE>DSE's</span> website
     for changes in the subscription fee or payment terms. If a change is
     unacceptable to you, you may, at your sole and exclusive remedy, terminate
     the EULA and close your Account as described in the termination section
     below. You are responsible for paying all applicable taxes (including
     those DSE is not required to collect) and for all hardware, software,

     to you upon 30 days notice in any of the following manners: (<span
     class=SpellE>i</span>) when you log into your Account; (ii) in a notice on
     <span class=SpellE>DSE's</span> website; (iii) via electronic mail; or <span

     to pay the subscription fee when due; (ii) DSE is unable to verify or
     authenticate any information you provide; (iii) you or anyone using any of
     your Accounts materially breaches the EULA, makes any unauthorized use of

     close all of your Accounts by notifying DSE via electronic mail within thirty
     (30) days after the later of (a) the date that DSE has posted the change
     on its website; or (b) the date the change has impacted your Account
     (e.g., your credit card has been charged). Your notice must state: (<span

     your termination notice. If you continue to access the System or use
     Beyond Protocol&#8482; more than thirty (30) days after the later to occur

     you are prompted to review and agree to the amended EULA; or (b) notifying
     DSE via electronic mail within thirty (30) days after the amended EULA was

     &quot;ACCEPT&quot; button, accessed the System or played the Game during
     that period. Your notice must state: (<span class=SpellE>i</span>) that
     you do not agree to the amended EULA, specifically describing the
     amendment(s) with which you disagree, and request DSE to close all of your
     Accounts; (ii) your true name; (iii) your current postal address; (iv)
     your current e-mail address; (v) your login name; (vi) your player name;

     under this section. <br>

     not be entitled to compensation for the past time you spent playing Beyond
     Protocol&#8482;, for the real or projected value of your Account were it
     to be sold, or for any other compensation, other than a prorated refund of
     prepaid subscription fees under certain circumstances as expressly set

     <br>
     <b>C. User Content</b> <br>
     The System may allow you to communicate information, such as by posting
     messages in chat rooms, on bulletin boards and other user-to-user areas
     (collectively, &quot;User Content&quot;). <br>
     User Content that you cause to be communicated to the System may not (<span

     infringe or violate the intellectual property, proprietary, privacy or
     publicity rights of any third party; (iii) be defamatory, indecent,
     obscene, child pornographic or harmful to minors; or (iv) contain any
     viruses, Trojan horses, disabling code, worms, time bombs, &quot;clear <span
     class=SpellE>GIFs</span>,&quot; <span class=SpellE>cancelbots</span> or
     other computer programming or routines that are intended to, or which in
     fact, damage, detrimentally interfere with, monitor, intercept or
     expropriate any data, information, packets or personal information. <br>
     <br>
     DSE may take any action it deems appropriate regarding any User Content,
     if DSE believes, in its sole discretion, that such User Content violates
     the EULA or may expose DSE, its licensors and/or its suppliers to
     liability, damage <span class=SpellE>DSE's</span> relationship with any of
     its suppliers, licensors, ISPs or other users of Beyond Protocol&#8482;,
     harm anyone or harm <span class=SpellE>DSE's</span> reputation or

     rights, in and to all or any part of your User Content, in any medium now
     known or hereafter developed. <br>
     <br>
     Violation of <span class=SpellE>DSE's</span> proprietary rights is a
     material breach of the EULA, in the event of which DSE may suspend your
     Account, terminate the EULA and take whatever additional action DSE deems
     appropriate under the circumstance. The foregoing is without prejudice to
     or waiver of any and all of <span class=SpellE>DSE's</span> other rights
