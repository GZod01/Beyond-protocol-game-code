Hostilites on [EnvirName] have come to a decline as of [EndOfBattle]. The conflict has already claimed at least [TotalLostBothSides] lives and seen the loss of [TotalEntitiesLostBothSides] units and facilities.

Battle began [StartOfBattle] when battle elements of [PlayerSideListA] engaged the forces of [PlayerSideListB]. Skeptics feel this decline in combat may only be temporary and warn against regarding it as a downward trend.

Citizens of [EnvirName] are equally skeptical as the combat has already claimed countless lives of civilians and wrecked [TotalFacilitiesLostBothSides] facilities on both sides of the war. The individual colonial governments are anxious to begin the rebuilding process.
