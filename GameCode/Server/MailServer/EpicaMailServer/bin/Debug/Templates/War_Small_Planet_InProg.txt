Battle elements belonging to [PlayerSideListA] engaged in combat with the forces of [PlayerSideListB] on [StartOfBattle]. The conflict, which has already claimed [TotalLostBothSides] lives, is still being fought on [EnvirName].
<br><br>
Experts indicate that this may be the prelude to a much larger and drawn out campaign between these factions on [EnvirName]. With over [TotalEntitiesLostBothSides] units and facilities left in ruin already, it is sure to bring economic strain to the already strained economy of [EnvirName].
