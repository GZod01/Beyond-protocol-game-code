[PlayerName] and [PlayerName2] finished talks today that concluded an agreement to cease all hostilities immediately. Citizens of both empires sighed a heavy sigh of relief.
<br><br>
The agreement comes after [SpanOfWar] of fighting and anomosity since the war started on [StartOfWar]. Experts are unsure if the truce will last or if tensions will escalate into open conflict again, however, the truce is always welcome.
