[PlanetName] is believed to only have 25% of its planet-wide resources left. Human's persistence on exploiting [PlanetName]'s wealth has limited further exploitation of [PlanetName]. New resources must be found or [ColonyName]'s growth will be hampered. Regional financial markets anticipate a decline in the production capability of the colony. Financial experts point out that while its growth can be sustained; we can look forward to an increase in low-income households, unemployment, and crime.</div>
