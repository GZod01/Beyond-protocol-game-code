What started as a minor fight on [StartOfBattle] has developed into a massive conflict as space-based units from [PlayerSideListA] continue to engage forces of [PlayerSideListB]. This massive conflict has already claimed [TotalLostBothSides] lives on both sides of the line.

The conflict has also begun piling up space debris as [TotalUnitLostBothSides] vessels have been wrecked and remain floating in space. The GTC has already begun making appropriations for clearing vital space lanes in the area of the more intense fighting.
