Hostilites in [EnvirName] have come to a decline as of [EndOfBattle]. The conflict has already claimed at least [TotalLostBothSides] lives and seen the loss of [TotalEntitiesLostBothSides] units and facilities.

Battle began [StartOfBattle] when battle elements of [PlayerSideListA] engaged the forces of [PlayerSideListB]. Skeptics feel this decline in combat may only be temporary and warn against regarding it as a downward trend.

The Galactic Trade Commission has begun taking advantage of the pause in combat to make large progress on clearing the debris left behind from the battles.
