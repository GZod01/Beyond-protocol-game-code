The skirmish came as a surprise to the citizens of the [EnvirName] system as the first shells hit their targets. Experts expected this conflict to draw on longer than it did. Skeptics warn that this decline should not be considered permanent and that more hostilities are probable as long as relations between the two factions remain strained.
