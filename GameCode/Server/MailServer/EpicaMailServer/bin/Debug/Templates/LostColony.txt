Contact with the [ColonyName] colony has been lost. The colony was located in [EnvirName]. Officials are still attempting to piece together the colony's demise.

Immediate impressions are that the colony was lost due to [ColonyLostReason]. [PlayerName] was the leader of the colony, however, representatives could not be contacted for comment.
<br><br>
The colony was established on [ColonyStart] and grew in size and population up to a total citizenship of [MaxTotalPopulation]. It is unclear if the colony will be rebuilt or not.
