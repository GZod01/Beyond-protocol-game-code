After [SpanOfBattle], hostilities have seemingly drawn to an end in [EnvirName]. The turmoil of the engagement claimed [TotalLostBothSides] lives on both sides of the line.
<br><br>
The combat began [StartOfBattle] when [PlayerSideListA] forces clashed with [PlayerSideListB] forces. It was unclear at the start of the battle how devastating it would be. The wreckage left in the space lanes will be an issue for quite a while as crews begin the salvage process.
<br><br>
It is unclear the costs of the battle in monetary amounts and how far the conflict will set back the civilizations of the sides involved. As more than [TotalUnitsLostBothSides] military assets are left in ruin floating in space, it will remain uncertain how both sides of the conflict will rebound.
<br><br>
It is still unclear whether this decline in hostilities is permanent or if it is only temporary. While relations remain strained between the warring factions, everything remains uncertain.
